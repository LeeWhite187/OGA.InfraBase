    <description>Base library for infrastructure classes, and entities of any Id type.</description>
    <releaseNotes>Type:			Project Release Notes
For:			Infrastructure Base Library
Date:			20220927
Description:	This is the base set of classes to be consumed by an infrastructure library of a domain-designed project.
It includes the following:
The DabaseContext base class, which needs to be referenced by all database-specific context classes.
Attributes for decorating data context classes, so they can be cataloged at application startup, for automated
instanciation and dependency injection.
A data context extension, that can check if migration are applied and get a list of pending migrations.
A generic Paginated List class, which can be used by repository implementations for composing and returning
paginated results of a particular type.
The generic repository base class that can be used by domain services for data context interaction.
The Config Update Service class, which provides accessibility to build data of the running process.
The Config Service class, that provides key-value access to configuration data, stored in a database.
The URI Service class, which simplifies the ability to decorate a URL with query parameters for
a specific page of result data.
Targets:		Only one compiled target is currently generated, that supports all entity ID datatypes (string, int, Guid, etc), using a generic.

Build:		19
Changes:
1.	Updated the Infrastructure Base project to utilize a generic type for the entity ID across all classes.

Release:	v1.2.0
Date:		20220204
Build:		16
Changes:
1.	Updated PaginatedList class to put the new keyword back on the CreateAsync with URI parameter.
After some testing, the new keyword is actually needed for this call.
2.	Update PaginatedList with URL class to fix a logic flaw in its constructor.
From testing, the constructor of the derived URL class, adds a duplicate set of entries.
This is because the base class already adds the range of elements.
So, the actions in the constructor are commented out, to prevent data duplication.
